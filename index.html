 <h1>Reentry Guide: Web Optimization</h1>

<p>
EJP is collaborating with Chi Hack Night volunteers to create an online version
of the reentry guide. We hope this online version will make the guide easier to
find, easier to distribute, and more efficient to use.
</p>


<p>EJP and Hack Night volunteers met to discuss context of use for the guide. We
identified scenarios and information needs. To summarize, these are the key
challenges and opportunities for creating a web-optimized version of the guide:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Search engine optimization
    </li>
    <li>
        Single-source publishing
    </li>
    <li>
        Performance and efficiency
    </li>
    <li>
        Creating custom collections of topics to share and print
    </li>
    <li>
        Sharing via phone calls and visits
    </li>
</ul>


<p>
    The details of these are defined further throughout this report.
