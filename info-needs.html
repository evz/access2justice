<h3>Stress cases</h3>
<p>
We have defined some uses cases in the form of stress cases. The
benefit of <a
href=“https://npr.design/designing-news-products-with-empathy-50-stress-cases-to-consider-61f068a939eb#.2byz2rebn”>stress
cases</a> is in considering realistic, important uses that require the
guide to meet the challenges of a stressful situation. If readers can
find and share the information they need in these circumstances, then
the guide will perform that much better in less stressful cases.
