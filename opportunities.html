    </li>
    <li>
        Foster hope during incarceration
    </li>
    <li>
        Support utilizing time incarcerated to advance education
    </li>
    <li>
        Take advantage of increased attention from prison counselors prior to release
    </li>
    <li>
        Foster peace of mind about release
    </li>
    <li>
        Support being prepared
        <ul>
            <li>
                Timelines
