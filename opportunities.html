<ul>
    <li>
        Support being productive while incarcerated
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspire to a get ahead start on finding resources (if less than 5 year to release)
    </li>
    <li>
        Foster hope during incarceration
    </li>
    <li>
        Support utilizing time incarcerated to advance education
    </li>
    <li>
        Take advantage of increased attention from prison counselors prior to release
    </li>
    <li>
        Foster peace of mind about release
    </li>
    <li>
        Support being prepared
            <li>
                Timelines
            </li>
